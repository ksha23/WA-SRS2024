\subsubsection{Vehicle Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
        \item[VD\_1] The vehicle (or simulated vehicle) shall receive CAN control (steering, braking, torque) messages at the required bus baud rate from the control stack.
        \item[VD\_2] The vehicle state estimator shall update at a rate of 100 Hz.
        \item[VD\_3] Vehicle maximum speed shall be 25 mph (11.2 m/s).
        \item[VD\_4] Vehicle maximum steering angle shall be $\pm$ 45 degrees.
        \item[VD\_5] Vehicle maximum lateral acceleration shall be $\pm$ 3.5 m/s.
        \item[VD\_6] Vehicle maximum longitudinal acceleration shall be $\pm$ 4 m/s.
        \item[VD\_7] Vehicle dimensions (box) are 169.5”L x 69.7”W x 63.6”H (4.306m L x 1.77m W x 1.616m H).
        \item[VD\_8] The vehicle model's geometric center shall be located below the center of the rear axle (at ground level) for the purposes of model-based control and planning.
